IDK what this project is yet but I created the repository and then
cloned it to my computer. I will also commit it to GitHub at some point.

This is a small collection of my favorite recipes. I added images and lists of ingredients and steps to make the recipes.

I'm still a little confused on how often I should commit to git. I'm sure I will get the hang of it.
