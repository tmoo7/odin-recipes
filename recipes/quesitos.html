    <h3>Delicious puertorican pastry with cream cheese filling.</h3>
    <p>
      Quesitos are a popular Puertorican pastry found in every bakery on the
      island. It is made with puff pastry and filled with a delicious cream
      cheese mixture.

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>1 8oz pkg of cream cheese, softened</li>
      <li>Puff pastry sheet</li>
      <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
      <li>Sugar, for garnish</li>
      <li>2 tsp vanilla</li>
      <li>Corn Syrup, for garnish</li>
      <li>Water</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat your oven to 350ºF and set aside a parchment or silpat lined
        baking sheet.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a medium mixing bowl, stir together the cream cheese, powdered sugar,
        vanilla extract, and salt. Combine until fully mixed and very smooth and
        creamy (I used a silicone spatula).
      </li>
      <li>
        Gently remove the thawed puff pastry sheet and gently roll out using a
        rolling pin or wine bottle to make sure the creases are flattened. Then,
        using a sharp knife, cut the sheet into thirds lengthwise and then
        across, creating 9 squares per sheet of dough, giving you 18 squares
        total.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spoon 2 tablespoons of the cream cheese filling into the center of the
        square and spreading down a little bit into a strip (you can also pipe
        in the filling with a piping bag or cut-off plastic storage bag if you
        want to make them super neat). Fold over each corner into the center,
        making sure to overlap the sides on top of one another. Repeat this step
        with the remaining dough and filling.
      </li>
      <li>
        Using a pastry brush, brush the beaten egg over the quesitos and
        sprinkle with a little bit of granulated sugar. Bake for 25-30 minutes,
        rotating the pan halfway through until the dough is puffed up and
        they&apos;re nice and golden brown.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once removed from the oven, brush them with the corn syrup and sprinkle
        with a little more granulated sugar for crunch. Enjoy with a big cup of
        coffee!

      <li>¡Buen provecho!</li>
